# 📊 Cohort Retention Analytics (End-to-End | Microsoft Fabric + Power BI)

---

## Executive Summary

This project analyzes **customer retention behavior using cohort analysis** on a real-world e-commerce dataset.
The objective is to understand **how long customers stay active after their first purchase**, identify **key churn points**, and evaluate **long-term customer value**.

Using **Microsoft Fabric (SQL + Semantic Model)** and **Power BI**, I built an end-to-end analytics solution covering data cleaning, cohort modeling, retention metrics, and an interactive dashboard.
The analysis reveals **strong early retention**, **high repeat purchase behavior**, and a **small but valuable long-term loyal user base**.

## Business Problem

Customer acquisition is expensive, and long-term growth depends on **retaining customers beyond their first purchase**.

Key business questions addressed:

* How many customers return after their first purchase?
* Where does the **largest drop-off** in retention occur?
* Do retained users generate meaningful long-term value?
* How does retention evolve month-by-month after acquisition?

Answering these questions helps product and growth teams prioritize **onboarding improvements, lifecycle nudges, and loyalty strategies**.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Cleaned raw order data to create a reliable order-level dataset
   * Handled missing customers, duplicates, and invalid dates
   * Derived order month and customer purchase timelines

2. **Cohort Definition**

   * Defined `cohort_month` as the customer’s first purchase month
   * Calculated `months_since_first_order` for each subsequent order

3. **Retention Modeling (SQL-First)**

   * Built a long-format retention table for flexible analysis
   * Created a wide retention matrix (Month-0 to Month-12) for heatmap visualization
   * Calculated cohort size, retained customers, and retention percentage

4. **Advanced Metrics**

   * Repeat purchase rate
   * Lifetime orders per customer (LTV proxy)
   * Orders per active customer over time

5. **Visualization**

   * Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard using a Fabric Semantic Model
   * Included KPIs, cohort heatmap, and retention decay analysis

## Results and Business Recommendations

### Key Results

* **Month-1 Retention:** 85.75% — strong early engagement
* **Repeat Purchase Rate:** 100% — all customers reordered at least once
* **Lifetime Orders per Customer:** ~16.6 orders
* **Churn Pattern:** Gradual decline, not abrupt drop-offs
* **Long-term Loyal Base:** ~10% of users remain active after 11 months

### Business Recommendations

1. Improve **post-first-order onboarding** to reduce early churn
2. Introduce **lifecycle nudges** between Month-1 and Month-3
3. Create **loyalty or subscription programs** for long-term retained users
4. Focus growth efforts on **retention optimization**, not just acquisition

## Next Steps

* Segment cohorts by **product category, order frequency, or geography**
* Add **revenue-based metrics** if pricing data is available
* Perform **A/B test analysis** on retention improvement initiatives
* Build predictive models to identify **high-risk churn users**
